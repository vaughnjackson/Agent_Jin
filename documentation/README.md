## 🚀 What is PAI?

PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure) is a powerful framework that enhances AI assistants with:

- **Skills System**: Modular capability packages activated by intent
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Load information as needed (SKILL.md → CLAUDE.md → Resources)
- **Hook System**: Event-driven automation for tool calls
- **Voice Notifications**: macOS native voice feedback with distinct agent voices
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different tasks
- **Security First**: Built with security best practices

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Skills Intelligence
- Intent-based skill activation
- Progressive information disclosure
- Modular capability packages
- Dynamic agent selection

### 2. Automation
- Pre and post-execution hooks
- Custom command integration
- Workflow automation
- Event-driven responses

### 3. Voice Integration
- macOS native Premium/Enhanced voices
- Zero API costs (100% offline)
- Distinct voices for Kai and each agent
- Real-time completion notifications

### 4. Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting
- CORS protection
- No hardcoded secrets

## 🔧 Environment Variables

PAI uses environment variables for configuration:

- `PAI_DIR`: PAI configuration directory (points to PAI_DIRECTORY)
- `PAI_HOME`: Your home directory
- `PORT`: Voice server port (default: 8888)
- `DA`: Digital Assistant name (optional)
- `DA_COLOR`: Display color (optional)

## System Requirements

- macOS 11+ (primary support)
- Bun runtime
- AI assistant access (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.)
- Optional: ElevenLabs API key
- Optional: SwiftBar for menu indicators

## Installation

```bash
# Clone PAI repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PAI.git
cd PAI

# Set PAI_DIR
export PAI_DIR="$HOME/PAI/PAI_DIRECTORY"

# Install voice server (optional)
cd PAI_DIRECTORY/voice-server
./install.sh

# Configure environment
cp ${PAI_DIR}/env-example ${PAI_DIR}/.env
# Edit ${PAI_DIR}/.env with your settings
```

## Configuration

PAI is configured through:
1. Environment variables in `${PAI_DIR}/.env`
2. Skills in `${PAI_DIR}/skills/`
3. Hook scripts in `${PAI_DIR}/hooks/`
4. Agent definitions in `${PAI_DIR}/agents/`
5. Slash commands in `${PAI_DIR}/commands/`

## Usage Examples

### Skill Activation
```bash
# Skills activate based on intent matching
"Help me with prompt engineering" → Activates prompting skill
"Create a new skill for X" → Activates create-skill
"Do research on AI trends" → Activates research skill (launches agents)
```

### Voice Notifications
```bash
# Send voice notification
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
  -d '{"message": "Task completed"}'
```

### Hook System
```yaml
# ${PAI_DIR}/hooks/user-prompt-submit.sh
# Automatically loads context before processing prompts
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Skill not activating | Check skill description in `<available_skills>` |
| Voice not working | Verify voice server running: `curl http://localhost:8888/health` |
| Hooks not triggering | Ensure hook scripts are executable |
| Port conflicts | Change PORT in `${PAI_DIR}/.env` |
