Editorial conceptual illustration in Saul Steinberg / New Yorker style.

WHITE BACKGROUND (#FFFFFF) for transparency removal.

STYLE: Hand-drawn black ink linework with these characteristics:
- Variable stroke weight (thicker where pressure would be)
- Imperfect, slightly wobbly lines (human quality)
- Gestural brush strokes, NOT smooth vectors
- Risograph / editorial aesthetic

COMPOSITION (2-3 elements only):
Two hands pulling apart a television screen like it's a pair of curtains, tearing the TV frame open in the center. Behind the torn TV screen, an ordinary Black man in business casual attire (button-down shirt, slacks) holding a briefcase, looking natural and everyday—not dramatic or posed.

The TV frame should look like it's being ripped or pulled apart like fabric, with jagged torn edges. The hands grip the edges of the frame firmly, pulling outward.

The man behind should be drawn simply and naturally—ordinary, calm, professional. He represents the "invisible" everyday person, not a dramatic figure.

Elements drawn with bold BLACK LINEWORK as primary.
Deep Purple (#4A148C) used sparingly on the man's shirt or briefcase as small ACCENT details only (5-10% of the man, not dominant).
Optional: Very subtle Deep Teal (#00796B) on one small element.

COLORS:
- BLACK is the PRIMARY color for all linework and main shapes
- Deep Purple #4A148C as small ACCENT only on the revealed man (shirt collar, briefcase detail—hints, not dominant)
- Teal #00796B sparingly if at all

The image should be predominantly BLACK LINEWORK with color used sparingly as accents on the revealed figure to draw the eye.

COMPOSITION: Full-bleed edge-to-edge. NO whitespace or margins.
Elements extend to or bleed off edges (hands reach from sides, TV frame fills frame). 100% frame fill.

The focal point is the contrast between the torn TV frame (media) and the ordinary man being revealed behind it (reality).

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- FLAT colors only — NO gradients, NO shading
- NO shadows of any kind
- Lines must look hand-drawn, NOT perfect vectors
- Color is ACCENT only on the revealed man, black linework dominates everything
- The man should look ORDINARY and everyday, not dramatic
- The TV frame should look torn/ripped like fabric or paper, not just opened
- This is about REVEALING the invisible, so the man should feel natural, not posed
