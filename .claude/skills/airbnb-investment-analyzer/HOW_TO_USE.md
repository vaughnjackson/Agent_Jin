## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use Recent Data**: Comparable property data should be from the last 3-6 months for accuracy
2. **Include Multiple Comps**: 5-10 comparable properties provide better projections than 1-2
3. **Be Conservative**: When estimating occupancy or expenses, err on the conservative side
4. **Consider Seasonality**: Account for high/low seasons specific to your market
5. **Check Regulations**: Verify local short-term rental laws before investing
6. **Include All Costs**: Don't forget closing costs, furnishings, renovation, and ongoing expenses
7. **Compare Multiple Properties**: Use the comparative analyzer to evaluate alternatives
8. **Run Scenarios**: Test different occupancy rates and expense levels to understand risk
