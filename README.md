# The best AI in the world should be available to everyone

</div>

Right now the most powerful AI setups are being built inside companies for efficiency and profits.

That's all good, but I think the purpose of technology is to serve humans—not the other way around. These new AI frameworks should be available to everyone, including people not in technology, so that regular people can use it to help them flourish.

That's what PAI is. It's the foundation for building a Personal AI System that understands your larger goals and context, gets better over time, and that works for *you* because it's *yours*. Not some generic chatbot. Not some common assistant. A full platform for magnifying yourself and your impact on the world.

## What is PAI?

PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure) is an open-source template for building your own AI-powered operating system. It's currently built on [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), but designed to be platform-independent — the architecture, skills, and workflows are structured so future migrations to other AI platforms are straightforward.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Skills** | Self-contained AI capabilities with routing, workflows, and documentation |
| **Agents** | Specialized AI personalities for different tasks (engineer, researcher, designer) |
| **Hooks** | Event-driven automation that captures work and manages state |
| **History** | Automatic documentation system (UOCS) that captures everything |

> [!TIP]
> **Start clean, small, and simple.** Build the scaffolding that makes AI reliable.

<br/>

## What's New in v0.9.0

Big updates! PAI is now fully **platform-agnostic** — your AI identity, your system.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 📊 **Observability Dashboard** | Real-time agent monitoring with live charts |
| 🎭 **Genericized Identity** | Configure your DA name, it flows everywhere |
| ⚙️ **Better Configuration** | Clear docs for all environment variables |

👉 [**See full changelog**](#-updates)

<br/>


## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone PAI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure.git
cd Personal_AI_Infrastructure
```

### 2. Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
.claude/tools/setup/bootstrap.sh
```

The bootstrap script will:
- Check your shell (recommends zsh or bash)
- Install Bun if needed (PAI's package manager)
- Check for Claude Code
- Launch the interactive setup wizard

The setup wizard will:
- Ask where to install PAI (default: `~/.claude`)
- Configure your name and email
- Name your AI assistant (default: "Kai")
- Choose a color theme
- Set up voice server (macOS)
- Add environment variables to your shell

### 3. Add Your API Keys

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp ~/.claude/.env.example ~/.claude/.env

# Edit with your API keys
nano ~/.claude/.env
```

### 4. Start Claude Code

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # Load PAI environment
claude
```

> [!TIP]
> **Non-interactive setup** for automation:
> ```bash
> bun run setup.ts --pai-dir ~/.claude --name "Your Name" --email you@example.com --force
> ```

📚 For detailed setup, see [`docs/QUICKSTART.md`](docs/QUICKSTART.md)

## 🎨 Examples

Explore example skills in `.claude/skills/`:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **observability/** | Real-time agent monitoring dashboard with WebSocket streaming |
| **brightdata/** | Four-tier progressive web scraping with automatic fallback |
| **fabric/** | **Native Fabric patterns** — 248 patterns run directly in Claude's context (no CLI needed) |
| **research/** | Multi-source research workflows |
| **create-skill/** | Templates for creating new skills |

Each skill demonstrates the skills-as-containers pattern with routing, workflows, and self-contained documentation.

### Native Fabric Patterns

The Fabric skill now executes patterns **natively** within Claude Code — no CLI spawning required:

- **Your subscription's power** — Patterns run with your Opus/Sonnet model, not Fabric's configured model
- **Full context** — Patterns have access to your entire conversation history
- **Faster execution** — No process spawning overhead
- **248 patterns included** — extract_wisdom, summarize, threat modeling, and more

```bash
# Update patterns from upstream
.claude/skills/fabric/tools/update-patterns.sh
```

Only use `fabric` CLI for YouTube transcripts (`-y`) or pattern updates (`-U`).

## 🏗️ The Thirteen Founding Principles

PAI is built on 13 foundational principles that define how to build reliable AI infrastructure.

Complete architecture documentation: [`.claude/skills/CORE/Architecture.md`](.claude/skills/CORE/Architecture.md)

---

### 1. Clear Thinking + Prompting is King

The quality of outcomes depends on the quality of thinking and prompts. Before any code, before any architecture—there must be clear thinking.

<img src="docs/images/principle-01-clear-thinking.png" alt="Clear Thinking + Prompting" width="100%">

---

### 2. Scaffolding > Model

The system architecture matters more than the underlying AI model. A well-structured system with good scaffolding will outperform a more powerful model with poor structure.

<img src="docs/images/principle-02-scaffolding.png" alt="Scaffolding > Model" width="100%">

---

### 3. As Deterministic as Possible

Favor predictable, repeatable outcomes over flexibility. Same input → Same output. Always.

<img src="docs/images/principle-03-deterministic.png" alt="Deterministic Systems" width="100%">

---

### 4. Code Before Prompts

Write code to solve problems, use prompts to orchestrate code. Prompts should never replicate functionality that code can provide.

<img src="docs/images/principle-04-code-before-prompts.png" alt="Code Before Prompts" width="100%">

---

### 5. Spec / Test / Evals First

Define expected behavior before writing implementation. If you can't specify it, you can't test it. If you can't test it, you can't trust it.

<img src="docs/images/principle-05-spec-test-evals.png" alt="Spec / Test / Evals First" width="100%">

---

### 6. UNIX Philosophy

Do one thing well. Compose tools through standard interfaces. Build small, focused tools—compose them for complex operations.

<img src="docs/images/principle-06-unix-philosophy.png" alt="UNIX Philosophy" width="100%">

---

### 7. ENG / SRE Principles

Apply software engineering and site reliability practices to AI systems. AI infrastructure is infrastructure—treat it with the same rigor.

<img src="docs/images/principle-07-eng-sre.png" alt="ENG / SRE Principles" width="100%">

---

### 8. CLI as Interface

Every operation should be accessible via command line. If there's no CLI command for it, you can't script it or test it reliably.

<img src="docs/images/principle-08-cli-interface.png" alt="CLI as Interface" width="100%">

---

### 9. Goal → Code → CLI → Prompts → Agents

The proper development pipeline for any new feature. Each layer builds on the previous—skip a layer, get a shaky system.

<img src="docs/images/principle-09-implementation-pipeline.png" alt="Implementation Pipeline" width="100%">

---

### 10. Meta / Self Update System

The system should be able to improve itself. A system that can't update itself will stagnate.

<img src="docs/images/principle-10-self-update.png" alt="Self-Improving System" width="100%">

---

### 11. Custom Skill Management

Skills are the organizational unit for all domain expertise. Skills are how PAI scales—each new domain gets its own skill, maintaining organization as the system grows.

<img src="docs/images/principle-11-skill-management.png" alt="Skill Architecture" width="100%">

---

### 12. Custom History System

Automatic capture and preservation of valuable work. Memory makes intelligence compound. Without history, every session starts from zero.

<img src="docs/images/principle-12-history-system.png" alt="History System" width="100%">

---

### 13. Custom Agent Personalities / Voices

Specialized agents with distinct personalities for different tasks. Personality isn't decoration—it's functional.

PAI is the technical foundation for [Human 3.0](https://human3.unsupervised-learning.com) — a program I created to help people transform into a version of themselves that can thrive in the post-corporate world that's coming. Human 3.0 means AI-augmented humans who build and control their own AI systems.

Right now, the most sophisticated AI infrastructure exists inside corporations with massive engineering teams. PAI exists to change that. To give individuals the same scaffolding that companies spend millions building.

Your AI, knowing how you work, learning from your patterns, serving your goals — not some corporation's engagement metrics. That's what this enables.
