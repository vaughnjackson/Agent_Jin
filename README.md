## This project exists so that the best AI in the world is not only used by a few, but can be used by everyone.

</div>

<br/>

Right now the most powerful AI setups are being built inside companies with massive engineering teams, and for the purpose of increasing efficiency and profits.

That's all good, but I think the purpose of technology is to serve humans—not the other way around. These new AI frameworks should be available to everyone, including people not in technology, so that regular people can use it to help them flourish.

That's what PAI is. It's the foundation for building a Personal AI System that understands your larger goals and context, gets better over time, and that works for *you* because it's *yours*. Not some generic chatbot. Not some common assistant. A full platform for magnifying yourself and your impact on the world.

## What is PAI?

PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure) is an open-source template for building your own AI-powered operating system. It's currently built on [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), but designed to be platform-independent — the architecture, skills, and workflows are structured so future migrations to other AI platforms are straightforward.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Skills** | Self-contained AI capabilities with routing, workflows, and documentation |
| **Agents** | Specialized AI personalities for different tasks (engineer, researcher, designer) |
| **Hooks** | Event-driven automation that captures work and manages state |
| **History** | Automatic documentation system (UOCS) that captures everything |

> [!TIP]
> **Start clean, small, and simple.** Build the scaffolding that makes AI reliable.

## What's New in v0.9.0

Big updates! PAI is now fully **platform-agnostic** — your AI identity, your system.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 📊 **Observability Dashboard** | Real-time agent monitoring with live charts |
| 🎭 **Genericized Identity** | Configure your DA name, it flows everywhere |
| ⚙️ **Better Configuration** | Clear docs for all environment variables |

👉 [**See full changelog**](#-updates)

<br/>


## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone PAI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure.git
cd Personal_AI_Infrastructure
```

### 2. Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
.claude/tools/setup/bootstrap.sh
```

The bootstrap script will:
- Check your shell (recommends zsh or bash)
- Install Bun if needed (PAI's package manager)
- Check for Claude Code
- Launch the interactive setup wizard

The setup wizard will:
- Ask where to install PAI (default: `~/.claude`)
- Configure your name and email
- Name your AI assistant (default: "Kai")
- Choose a color theme
- Set up voice server (macOS)
- Add environment variables to your shell

### 3. Add Your API Keys

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp ~/.claude/.env.example ~/.claude/.env

# Edit with your API keys
nano ~/.claude/.env
```

### 4. Start Claude Code

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # Load PAI environment
claude
```

> [!TIP]
> **Non-interactive setup** for automation:
> ```bash
> bun run setup.ts --pai-dir ~/.claude --name "Your Name" --email you@example.com --force
> ```

📚 For detailed setup, see [`docs/QUICKSTART.md`](docs/QUICKSTART.md)

## 🏗️ Architecture

PAI is built on 12 foundational principles:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**π Scaffolding > Model**<br/>
The infrastructure matters more than any single model

**π ENG / SRE**<br/>
Treat AI systems like production engineering

**π As Deterministic as Possible**<br/>
Reduce randomness, increase reliability

**π Code Before Prompts**<br/>
Write code first, wrap with prompts second

**π UNIX Philosophy**<br/>
Small, composable tools that do one thing well

**π CLI as Interface**<br/>
Command line is the primary interaction layer

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**π Goal → Code → CLI → Prompts → Agent**<br/>
The implementation hierarchy

**π Spec / Test / Evals First**<br/>
Define success before building

**π Meta / Self Updates**<br/>
The system improves itself

**π Custom Skill Management**<br/>
3-tier architecture, routing, workflows, tools

**π History**<br/>
Automatic documentation of all work

**π Custom Agent Personalities / Voices**<br/>
Specialized agents for different tasks

</td>

### Core Systems

<details open>
<summary><strong>Skills Architecture</strong> — 3-tier progressive disclosure</summary>

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="docs/images/skills-architecture.png">
  <img alt="Skills Architecture" src="docs/images/skills-architecture.png" width="800">
</picture>

Skills are self-contained containers with SKILL.md as the entry point. Workflows handle multi-step operations, tools provide CLI scripts, and docs contain reference material — all progressively loaded only when needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Hook System</strong> — Event-driven automation</summary>

<br/>

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/images/hook-system.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="docs/images/hook-system.png">
  <img alt="Hook System" src="docs/images/hook-system.png" width="800">
</picture>

Hooks capture everything automatically — before tool execution, after tool execution, and on user feedback. Scripts like `capture-all-events.ts` and `capture-session-summary.ts` run invisibly to build context.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>History System</strong> — Automatic documentation (UOCS)</summary>

<br/>

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/images/history-system.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="docs/images/history-system.png">
  <img alt="History System" src="docs/images/history-system.png" width="800">
</picture>

Everything is captured, nothing is lost. Session work, tool outputs, and agent results flow into the history system, producing markdown files, JSONL logs, and timestamped entries organized by date.

PAI is the technical foundation for [Human 3.0](https://human3.unsupervised-learning.com) — a program I created to help people transform into a version of themselves that can thrive in the post-corporate world that's coming. Human 3.0 means AI-augmented humans who build and control their own AI systems.

Right now, the most sophisticated AI infrastructure exists inside corporations with massive engineering teams. PAI exists to change that. To give individuals the same scaffolding that companies spend millions building.

Your AI, knowing how you work, learning from your patterns, serving your goals — not some corporation's engagement metrics. That's what this enables.
