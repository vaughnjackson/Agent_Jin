## This project exists so that the best AI in the world is not only used by a few, but can be used by everyone.

</div>

<br/>

Right now the most powerful AI setups are being built inside companies with massive engineering teams, and for the purpose of increasing efficiency and profits.

That's all good, but I think the purpose of technology is to serve humans—not the other way around. These new AI frameworks should be available to everyone, including people not in technology, so that regular people can use it to help them flourish.

That's what PAI is. It's the foundation for building a Personal AI System that understands your larger goals and context, gets better over time, and that works for *you* because it's *yours*. Not some generic chatbot. Not some common assistant. A full platform for magnifying yourself and your impact on the world.

<br/>

## What is PAI?

PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure) is an open-source template for building your own AI-powered operating system. It's currently built on [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), but designed to be platform-independent — the architecture, skills, and workflows are structured so future migrations to other AI platforms are straightforward.

## 🏗️ Architecture

PAI is built on 12 foundational principles:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**π Scaffolding > Model**<br/>
The infrastructure matters more than any single model

**π ENG / SRE**<br/>
Treat AI systems like production engineering

**π As Deterministic as Possible**<br/>
Reduce randomness, increase reliability

**π Code Before Prompts**<br/>
Write code first, wrap with prompts second

**π UNIX Philosophy**<br/>
Small, composable tools that do one thing well

**π CLI as Interface**<br/>
Command line is the primary interaction layer

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**π Goal → Code → CLI → Prompts → Agent**<br/>
The implementation hierarchy

**π Spec / Test / Evals First**<br/>
Define success before building

**π Meta / Self Updates**<br/>
The system improves itself

**π Custom Skill Management**<br/>
3-tier architecture, routing, workflows, tools

**π History**<br/>
Automatic documentation of all work

**π Custom Agent Personalities / Voices**<br/>
Specialized agents for different tasks

</td>

PAI is the technical foundation for [Human 3.0](https://human3.unsupervised-learning.com) — a program I created to help people transform into a version of themselves that can thrive in the post-corporate world that's coming. Human 3.0 means AI-augmented humans who build and control their own AI systems.

Right now, the most sophisticated AI infrastructure exists inside corporations with massive engineering teams. PAI exists to change that. To give individuals the same scaffolding that companies spend millions building.

Your AI, knowing how you work, learning from your patterns, serving your goals — not some corporation's engagement metrics. That's what this enables.
